During this phase, regional areas of the country will receive wind from various directions with low speeds, which poses as a potential for the formation of a thunderstorm, it said in a statement on Saturday (Sept 21). Thunderstorms along with heavy downpours and strong winds are expected during the evening and night in the West Coast and interior areas of Peninsular Malaysia, the west coast of Sabah, and central Sarawak, as well as its west coast.
